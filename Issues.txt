LANGUAGE
- When switching languages, swing goes weird and when it reloads it resizes back to original window size
- The mean filter pop-up asks “Please enter a positive value” and is not translated

NOT URGENT
- Gaussian and median filter’s popup's for value input dont explain why they need a value
- Colour cycling pop-up could use a line of instruction to make it more straightforward to the user
- Improve popups, to make them all match and feel integrated
